# This code fetches the current weather conditions for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
# It constructs a weather report that includes temperature, pressure, humidity, and a brief description of the weather.
# The report is printed to the console after the user inputs the city name.
# The code is structured to be run as a standalone script, with the main function being called when the script is executed directly.
